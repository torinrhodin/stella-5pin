    <h3>STUDY DESIGN</h3>
    <p>
      <span class='bullet'>*</span>A randomized, multicentre, double-masked, active-controlled study in adult patients with macular edema secondary to BRVO. Patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to either EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> 2&nbsp;mg (FAS, N=91) administered every 4 weeks (for a total of 6 injections) or laser photocoagulation (n=92) administered at baseline and subsequently as needed at and after Week 12 (laser control group). After 6 monthly injections (Week 24), patients in the EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> group received an injection every 2&nbsp;months (8 weeks) up to Week 52 and rescue laser treatment was permitted at Week 36 if at least 1&nbsp;rescue treatment criterion was met. For patients randomized to the laser control group, additional rescue laser treatment and rescue treatment with EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> starting at Week 24 (3 monthly injections followed by an injection every 2 months) were also permitted if the specific rescue criteria were met. Rescue criterion for both the EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> group and for patients randomized to the laser control group were: >50 micron increase in CRT on OCT compared to the lowest previous measurement, new 
      <br>or persistent cystic retinal changes or sub-retinal fluid on OCT or persistent diffuse edema in the central subfield on OCT or a loss of â‰¥5 letters from the best previous measurement due to BRVO, 
      <br>in conjunction with any increase in retinal thickness in the central subfield on OCT from the best previous measurement. 9 of 91 patients in the EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> group received laser therapy at Week 36 and 67 of 90 patients in the laser group received EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> treatment after Week 24.
