    <h3>STUDY DESIGN</h3>
    <p>
      <span class='bullet'>*</span>A randomized, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled study in adult patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes presenting with central DME involvement in the study eye. Patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> 2&nbsp;mg Q4 (n=155), EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> 2&nbsp;mg Q8 following 5 initial monthly doses (n=154) or active control laser (n=156). Beginning at Week 24, patients meeting a<br>pre-specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive additional treatment: patients in EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> groups could receive laser and patients in laser group could receive EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup>. EYLEA<sup class="reg">&reg;</sup> 2&nbsp;mg Q4 is not a recommended dose.
